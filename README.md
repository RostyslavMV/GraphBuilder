# GraphBuilder
Lab 3 - Project OOP

A program to build graphs of continuous functions

C# WPF

Library used: Microsoft.InteractiveDataDisplay.WPF

For function calculating Calc.dll was generated based on iformation here:

https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/46350/Evaluate-Expressions-from-C-using-JavaScript-s-Eva

Math functions available:

abs(x), acos(x), asin(x), atan(x), ceil(x), cos(x), exp(x), floor(x), log(x), pow(x), round(x), sin(x), sqrt(x), tan(x)

Operators available:

+, -, *, /, (, )

Microsoft.InteractiveDataDisplay.WPF used for easier displaying of graphs of functions. This library was chosen, because it is user friendly
and well optimized. To install this library, you just nedd to put dlls in your project and set References. Documentation is clear, you can
easilly find sample projects, so it is easy to understand what do you have to write in code. I can't say that there is something bad in
this library, everything was fine. I belive, that for this moment, there is nothing to redo/refactor, but in the future, when
adding new functionality, maybe it will be better to put everything into folders and so on.
